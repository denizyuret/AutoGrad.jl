# Contents:

# Here are the rough steps performed by g(x) where g=grad(f):
# 1. g is called with the same inputs as f.
# 2. g calls forward_pass which boxes x in a Rec type and calls f(Rec(x)).
# 3. If a primitive operator inside f gets a Rec input, it records its action and returns a Rec output.
# 4. g calls backward_pass which returns the gradient df/dx.

# And some background info:
# 5. How recording is done.
# 6. How new primitives and their gradients are defined.
# 7. How higher order gradients work.


# Details:

# 1. g is called with the same inputs as f.
# 1.1 g supports both regular and keyword args.
# 1.2 only one of the regular args is the gradient target, specified by the argnum argument of grad (defaults to 1).
# 1.3 in a typical model f would take parameters, return loss, with data kept in global variables.
# 1.4 to support multiple parameters, they can be grouped in a single arg using Array, Dict, or Tuple.

    grad(fun, argnum=1)

Take a function `fun(X...)->Y` and return another function
`gfun(X...)->dXi` which computes its gradient with respect to
positional argument number `argnum`. The function `fun` should be
scalar-valued. The returned function `gfun` takes the same arguments
as `fun`, but returns the gradient instead. The gradient has the same
type and size as the target argument which can be a Number, Array,
Tuple, or Dict.

# 5. How recording is done.

# 5.1 Rec: g=grad(f) calls forward_pass which calls f with one
# argument boxed in a Rec type.  The primitives inside f call their
# recorder methods when one of their arguments is a Rec.  The results
# of these recorder methods are also boxed in Rec types, which will
# cause downstream primitives to be recorded as well.  The final
# output of f, if not independent of the input, will thus be a Rec.

# 5.2 Node: Each result Rec created by a primitive keeps track of
# the function and the arguments that created the Rec.  Because a
# Rec may need to be recorded in multiple tapes for higher order
# derivatives (see Sec. 7) these dependencies are kept in a separate
# data structure called a Node.  The parents field of a Node is an
# array that points to the Nodes of the arguments.  The gradient wrt
# the result is kept in the outgrad field.  outgrad is an array
# because a node can have multiple descendents each of which will push
# a gradient to outgrad to be summed.

# 5.3 Tape: When forward_pass is done, we have the computation graph
# (dependency tree) of the result recorded in Nodes.  However we also
# need the time order in which these Nodes were created for the
# backward_pass.  The gradient functions of all the children of a node
# need to be called before its own gradient function.  For example if
# z depends on x and y, and y depends on x, we want to compute the
# gradients in z-y-x order.  If we do it in z-x-y order, the gradient
# function of x will be called before its descendent y.  Thus we keep
# a Tape which is an array of Nodes in the order they were created.

# 6. How new primitives and their gradients are defined.

# 6.1 Primitives

# AutoGrad primitives record their actions when they are called with
# some arguments boxed in Recs (However, see 6.3 for
# undifferentiable primitives). Julia supports multiple dispatch,
# i.e. a single function can have multiple methods with different arg
# types.  AutoGrad supports multiple dispatch for primitives and
# gradients, i.e. only some of the methods of a function can be
# defined as primitives and have gradients.  Calls to a particular
# method where some arguments are boxed in Recs are directed to the
# recorder function. The following example makes `sin(x::Number)` a
# primitive, but says nothing about e.g. `sin(x::Array)`.

#     let sin_r = recorder(sin)
#         global sin
#         sin{T<:Number}(x::Rec{T}) = sin_r(x)
#     end

# With multiple arguments, things get a bit more complicated.  There
# is no easy way to say "at least one argument is a Rec" in Julia.
# So one must define methods for all 2^N-1 combinations for
# boxed/unboxed arguments to be safe.  This example makes
# hypot(x1::Array,x2::Array) a primitive:

#     let local hypot_r = recorder(hypot)
#         global hypot
#         hypot{T<:Array,S<:Array}(x1::Rec{T},x2::Rec{S})=hypot_r(x1,x2)
#         hypot{T<:Array,S<:Array}(x1::Rec{T},x2::S)=hypot_r(x1,x2)
#         hypot{T<:Array,S<:Array}(x1::T,x2::Rec{S})=hypot_r(x1,x2)
#     end

# I wrote the @primitive macro in util.jl to automate this process.
# One restriction is the inability to target parametric methods such
# as `f{T<:Number}(AbstractArray{T})`.  Julia does not support
# `f{T<:Number,A<:AbstractArray{T}}(Rec{A})` yet.

# One could also choose to be lazy and just say:

#     hypot(x...) = hypot_r(x...)

# This would send any argument combination not covered by regular
# hypot methods to the recorder function, which presumably includes
# calls with boxed arguments.  This is dangerous for several reasons:
# (1) the Julia base may contain a typeless method (e.g. it does for
# `vcat`) we are overwriting. (2) this catches boxed calls to hypot
# methods we may not support yet.  So generally I would not recommend
# it.

# 6.2 Gradients

if !isdefined(@__MODULE__, :Grad)
"Grad{N} creates a type used by AutoGrad to represent the gradient wrt N'th arg."    
struct Grad{N}; end
end

# In AutoGrad, gradients are defined using gradient methods that have
# the following signature:

#     f(Grad{i},dy,y,x...) => dx[i]

# Here `f` is the name of original function, Grad{i} is a Type
# constant that specifies the gradient wrt the i'th argument, `dy` is
# the gradient wrt the output `y`, and `x...` are the input arguments.
# In this case `f` was originally called with `f(x...)` and returned
# `y`.  Somebody handed us the gradient `dy` wrt the output and
# `f(Grad{i},...)` above is going to give us the gradient `dx[i]` wrt
# the i'th argument.

# Note that type declarations on the x's can be used to specialize
# this gradient to any method of the function `f`.  Here is the
# gradient for `sin`:

# `sin{T<:Number}(::Type{Grad{1}}, dy, y, x::Rec{T})=dy*cos(x)

# For the second example a different gradient method is needed for
# each argument:

# `hypot{T<:Array,S<:Array}(::Type{Grad{1}},dy,y,x1::Rec{T},x2::Rec{S})=(dy.*x1./y)`
# `hypot{T<:Array,S<:Array}(::Type{Grad{2}},dy,y,x1::Rec{T},x2::Rec{S})=(dy.*x2./y)`

# And of course we need four more definitions for the other
# boxed/unboxed argument combinations, which the @primitive macro
# generates automatically.

# Finally, there are three cases of zero gradients that need to be
# handled:

# 6.3 Undifferentiable functions

# Piecewise constant functions such as `sign`, and non-numeric
# functions such as `size` are not differentiable wrt any of their
# arguments.  Unlike primitives, these functions do not need to record
# their action or return a boxed Rec.  They can just unbox their
# arguments and return an unboxed value:

# `size(a::Rec,i...)=size(a.value,i...)`

# The @zerograd macro defined in util.jl can be used to automate this.

# 6.4 Undifferentiable wrt unboxed arguments

# Methods such as `sum(a::Array,i::Int)` are only differentiable wrt
# some of their arguments (here `a` but not `i`).  These methods must
# record when their differentiable argument(s) are boxed and return
# boxed values.  If we are certain that their undifferentiable
# arguments are never going to be boxed, we can leave their gradients
# undefined:

#     let local sum_r = recorder(sum)
#         global sum
#         sum{T<:Array}(a::Rec{T},i::Int)=sum_r(a,i)
#         sum{T<:Array}(::Type{Grad{1}},dy,y,a::Rec{T},i::Int)=dy.+zeros(a)
#     end

# 6.5 Undifferentiable wrt boxed arguments

# Finally, in the rare cases when an undifferentiable argument can be
# boxed, its gradient must be defined and must return `nothing`.  The
# utility function `ungetindex` in intefaces.jl which uses its first
# argument's shape as a template is one example of this rare class.

# 6.6 sum_outgrads

sum_outgrads(a::Number, b::Number)=a+b
sum_outgrads(a::Tuple, b::Tuple)=tuple([sum_outgrads(x,y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)]...)
sum_outgrads(a::AbstractDict, b::AbstractDict) = (z=similar(a); for d in (a,b), (k,v) in d; z[k]=sum_outgrads(v,get(z,k,nothing)); end; z)
sum_outgrads(a::AbstractArray{T},b::AbstractArray{T}) where T = (if isbits(T); (a+b); else; T[sum_outgrads(x,y) for (x,y) in zip(a,b)]; end)
# sum_outgrads needs to be a primitive for higher order gradients:
let sum_outgrads_r = recorder(sum_outgrads); global sum_outgrads
    sum_outgrads(a::Rec,b::Rec)=sum_outgrads_r(a,b)
    sum_outgrads(a::Rec,b)=sum_outgrads_r(a,b)
    sum_outgrads(a,b::Rec)=sum_outgrads_r(a,b)
end
sum_outgrads(::Type{Grad{N}},dy,y,x1,x2) where N = dy
# we use `nothing` to indicate zero gradients
sum_outgrads(::Nothing,::Nothing)=nothing
sum_outgrads(a::Rec,::Nothing)=a   # to avoid ambiguity
sum_outgrads(::Nothing,a::Rec)=a   # to avoid ambiguity
sum_outgrads(a,::Nothing)=a
sum_outgrads(::Nothing,a)=a


# 7. How higher order gradients work.

# Say g=grad(f) and h=grad(g) and we call h(x).
# h(x) calls forward_pass(g,x)
# merge_tapes in forward_pass(g,x) is a noop because x is not a Rec.
# forward_pass(g,x) wraps x in v1=Rec(x,t1:n1) with tape t1 and node n1 and calls g(v1).
# g(v1) calls forward_pass(f,v1), which creates v2=Rec(x,t2:n2)
# merge_tapes in forward_pass(f,v1) creates v3=Rec(x,[t1:n31,t2:n32]) with parents n31->n1, n32->n2.
# forward_pass(f,v1) calls f(v3)
# primitives in f(v3) push their result Nodes on both [t1,t2] and record parents on each tape separately.
# f(v3) returns v4=Rec(y,[t1:n41,t2:n42]).
# g(v1) calls backward_pass(f)(v2,v4,t2).
# backward_pass(f) calls complete!(t2) and starts processing the nodes on t2 in reverse.
# the nodes on t2 only point to other nodes in t2, so backward_pass(f) fills outgrads on t2.
# backward_pass(f) calls gradient methods of the recorded primitives in f(v3).
# the operations of gradient methods are recorded only on t1, that is why we need iscomplete(t2) once we start backward_pass on t2.
# backward_pass(f) returns v5=Rec(df/dx,t1:n5) which becomes the output of forward_pass(g,x)
# h(x) calls backward_pass(g)(v1,v5,t1).
# backward_pass(g) calls gradient methods recorded in t1.
# even though some inputs are Recs again, nothing gets recorded and all primitives return values because t1 is complete.
# backward_pass(g) returns a regular value which becomes the output of h(x).
